Me Creating an Meditation Website/App 


I decided to try creating a meditation App using what I have learnt so far. I was able to first create
the HTML skeleton the followed it up with the CSS styling and flex box to positon my divs and different 
content. I finally did all the JavaScrip of the project to make sure all the buttons are working and are 
interactive and act as the user would expect them to work.
